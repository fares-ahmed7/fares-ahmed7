## 💫 About Me
I am an AI and Machine Learning Engineer focused on continuously developing my skills in artificial intelligence, machine learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. I have completed specialized courses in these areas, which have helped me build a solid foundation in core concepts such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning fundamentals, and generative models.

I am committed to continuous learning through structured courses, self-study, and trusted technical resources, with a strong interest in understanding how intelligent models work and how they can be leveraged to build effective AI-driven solutions. I also focus on strengthening my programming skills and analytical thinking to prepare for applying these concepts in real-world projects.

My goal is to continue growing in the field of artificial intelligence, contribute to forward-thinking projects, and help organizations harness the power of AI to drive meaningful change.
